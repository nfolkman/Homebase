# Homebase-Site
<b>Portfolio/Blog-esque Theme</b>

My intention with this site is to not only build something that can effectively function as a portfolio for my various web-dev projects, but also be a homebase for any other content that I'd like to post (not explicitly on a social media platform). <br> 
In a word or two, <b>a messy blog</b>.


<b>Tentative Launch Date:</b> Sunday, April 24th.
<br><b>Launched:</b> Sunday, April 24th! ðŸŽ‰
