# Homebase-Site
Portfolio/Blog-esque Site

My intention with this site is to not only build something that can effectively function as a portfolio for my various web-dev projects, but also be a homebase for any other content that I'd like to post (not explicitly on a social media platform). <br> 
In a word or two, <b>a messy blog</b>.
